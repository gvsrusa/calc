# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a modern, responsive calculator application that runs in web browsers. The calculator will provide standard arithmetic operations with a clean, intuitive user interface that works across desktop and mobile devices. It will support keyboard input, visual feedback, and maintain calculation history for improved user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to perform basic arithmetic calculations, so that I can quickly compute mathematical operations without external tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks a number button THEN the system SHALL display the number in the calculator display
2. WHEN the user clicks an operator button (+, -, ร, รท) THEN the system SHALL store the operation and prepare for the next number input
3. WHEN the user clicks the equals button THEN the system SHALL calculate and display the result of the arithmetic operation
4. WHEN the user performs division by zero THEN the system SHALL display an error message
5. IF the result exceeds the display capacity THEN the system SHALL format the number using scientific notation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to use keyboard shortcuts for calculator operations, so that I can input calculations more efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user presses number keys (0-9) THEN the system SHALL input the corresponding number
2. WHEN the user presses operator keys (+, -, *, /) THEN the system SHALL input the corresponding operation
3. WHEN the user presses Enter or = key THEN the system SHALL calculate the result
4. WHEN the user presses Escape or C key THEN the system SHALL clear the current calculation
5. WHEN the user presses Backspace THEN the system SHALL delete the last entered digit

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to clear my calculations and start fresh, so that I can begin new calculations without interference from previous ones.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks the Clear (C) button THEN the system SHALL reset the display to zero and clear all stored operations
2. WHEN the user clicks the Clear Entry (CE) button THEN the system SHALL clear only the current number being entered
3. WHEN the user starts a new calculation after getting a result THEN the system SHALL use the previous result as the starting number if an operator is pressed first

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the calculator to work well on both desktop and mobile devices, so that I can use it regardless of my device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the calculator is viewed on a mobile device THEN the system SHALL display buttons large enough for touch interaction
2. WHEN the calculator is viewed on different screen sizes THEN the system SHALL maintain proper proportions and readability
3. WHEN the user interacts with buttons THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback (hover states, active states)
4. IF the device supports touch THEN the system SHALL respond appropriately to touch gestures

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see a history of my recent calculations, so that I can reference previous results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user completes a calculation THEN the system SHALL add the calculation and result to the history
2. WHEN the user views the history THEN the system SHALL display the last 10 calculations in chronological order
3. WHEN the user clicks on a history item THEN the system SHALL load that result into the current display
4. WHEN the user clears the calculator THEN the system SHALL maintain the calculation history

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the calculator to handle decimal numbers, so that I can perform precise calculations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks the decimal point button THEN the system SHALL add a decimal point to the current number
2. WHEN the user tries to add multiple decimal points to one number THEN the system SHALL ignore additional decimal point inputs
3. WHEN the user performs calculations with decimal numbers THEN the system SHALL maintain appropriate precision
4. WHEN displaying decimal results THEN the system SHALL round to a reasonable number of decimal places to fit the display
